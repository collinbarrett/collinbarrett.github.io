I am a Christian, husband, and senior software engineer in Memphis, TN specializing in .NET.

## Bio

I grew up in Kalamazoo, MI, and I met my wife during my undergraduate program at [Cedarville
University](https://www.cedarville.edu/). We moved to Memphis, TN in 2012 for Jenny to complete the [Memphis Teacher
Residency](https://memphistr.org/). She continues to serve as a middle school ELA teacher at [The Collegiate School of
Memphis](https://www.collegiatememphis.org/), and she also loves to [bake](https://jennythebaker.com/). Our only other
household member is Bailey, a black lab/pit. When we are not working or traveling, we enjoy our [church
community](https://christcity.org/), our [Binghampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binghampton,_Memphis,_Tennessee)
neighbors, trying new restaurants, re-re-watching The Office, and drinking good coffee.

## Professional Experience

During my undergraduate program, I acquired a security clearance and worked for two years as a co-op software engineer
for a contractor at Wright-Patterson A.F.B. After college, I founded the computer science and robotics department at a
private, urban school in Memphis.

Since then, I have been rapidly growing my software engineering skills and business knowledge in a variety of domains
and teams. Currently, I primarily work with .NET. See [Resume](/assets/resume_collinmbarrett.pdf).

Internet privacy is important, so I built the first version of
[FilterLists](https://filterlists.com) in 2015 to scratch my own itch. It has been
iterated upon as a labor of love and served as a playground for me to learn, practice, and demonstrate new skills.
