Despite being way behind the curve on this one, I wanted to jot down some first impressions after one week with a standing desk. At my last gig, they started distributing these out to those who requested them right before I joined. I requested one, but the second wave of desks never arrived before my departure. This Monday, my new boss rolled in the standing desk that I had requested.

## Usage

As I had observed colleagues use standing desks in the past, I always assumed that the friction of manually raising and lowering the surface would prevent me from frequently adjusting my posture. The model that I have, though, has a surprisingly good counterbalancing mechanism that makes adjusting the height super quick and easy.

## Physical Effects

Over the course of the last four days, I have spent probably 50% of it standing. I can feel it, mostly on my heels. I ordered an anti-fatigue mat that I hope will help relieve some of that pressure. My goal was never to stand all day, but to change positions every hour or so. I hope that these two factors combined with building up endurance will make a habit of standing discomfort-free over time.

Additionally, the standing position certainly improves my posture all around. In my back, sure, since it is not tempting to slide down in my chair. But, I guess I was also surprised at how the limited desk space in the elevated platform forces improvement in my typing form. The only physical contact I make with the desk while standing and typing are my fingertips. Stay away, carpal tunnel.

## Mental Effects

My primary goal for trying one of these desks out was to fend off mental exhaustion and drowsiness that often sets in about mid-afternoon. Coffee can only do so much. It has only been a week, but I can say that it helps with that. Something about the standing posture contributes to sharpening my mental focus. I will have to wait and see if that is actually due to the new position, or if it is merely the newness.

So far, I am pleased with the results.<small></small>
