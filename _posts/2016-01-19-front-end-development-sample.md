When I was hunting for the position I am in now with [thyssenkrupp Elevator](https://www.tkelevator.com/us-en/), I had
also applied to a couple of web development roles. One of the potential employers asked me to create an HTML and CSS
static page based on only a layered PSD mockup that they provided. Fig. 1 is an export of the PSD they gave me. I
whipped this up over the course of a few days, and I wanted to share this front-end development sample on the blog for
posterity. The “Quanto” button will take you to my finished result. It is not a perfect render, but they received it
with satisfaction by the potential employer. As an aside, I used the [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/ "Pure CSS")
framework to speed along the process.
