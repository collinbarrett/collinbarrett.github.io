Today is my last day with Fred’s.

I joined the pharmacy IT group last year to replace their outgoing application developer. After a couple of weeks, IT
leadership re-organized me under the general application development group serving both pharmacy and retail business
applications.

Fred’s has been around a long time. Like many such organizations, it maintains legacy infrastructure and technical debt.
Leadership in recent years has been making great strides in the modernization of systems and procedures. The development
team is currently undergoing some significant rewrites creating modern [.NET
Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro) microservices hosted in the cloud. I
honestly wish I could have been around to see the completion of that migration, and I am excited for what the team has
in store for them.

I have grown tremendously in technical ability and customer service during my tenure. My skills in design patterns,
[.NET](/tag/dotnet/), [SQL Server](/tag/database/), SSIS, ORMs ([Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)
&amp; [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)), UI ([Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) &amp;
[DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/)), and build tools
([VSTS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) &amp;
[BuildMaster](https://inedo.com/buildmaster)) have rapidly improved thanks to an investment in education and refactoring
by current management. I even got to learn a few oddball skills like [JAMS](https://www.jamsscheduler.com/) and [Elixir
Repertoire](https://elixirtech.com/repertoire-2/).

I am thankful for the team, projects, and experiences that I have had at Fred’s. I sincerely hope that my time provided
as much value to the company as it did to me. I wish the team the best of luck moving forward.
