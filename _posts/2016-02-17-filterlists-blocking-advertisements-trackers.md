Using a software firewall (adblocker) has become an essential tool in protecting my privacy online. While the current
business model of the “free” Internet relies upon advertising revenue, publishers have become too flippant about
tracking users without their consent. Advertising networks track our browsing habits around the Internet building
lucrative profiles to exploit for targeted marketing or big data research. Until Internet publishers develop more
transparency or a new business model, we must continue to take the protection of our privacy into our hands.

Typical adblockers run as an extension in modern web browsers. As we browse the Internet, they compare the requests
being made by the sites we visit their list of hosts and filters to block advertisements, trackers, and general
annoyances selectively. This measure helps protect the surfer’s privacy, prevents [malvertising
attacks](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/malvertising-is-cybercriminals-latest-sweet-spot/ "Why Malvertising Is
Cybercriminals’ Latest Sweet Spot - Wired"), and [reduces bandwidth
requirements](https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/08/blocking-ads-can-cut-network-traffic-25-to-40-study-shows/ "Blocking
ads can cut network traffic 25% to 40%, study shows - VentureBeat"). Many individuals and organizations work hard to
maintain these filter lists for anyone to use. Locating and selecting these filter lists, however, is not a necessarily
easy process. This weekend, I built FilterLists for just that purpose. FilterLists is the community-driven, independent,
and comprehensive directory of all public filter lists for advertisements, trackers, and annoyances.
